Welcome to the Item Mana Aggregation Tool

The goal of the game is to get the Current Total to equal but not exceed the Target. 

Each Item adds it's value to the Current Total when pressed. A value that is between 1 and 12 and only revealed when it is first used.

Here is an example. Let's say the game begins with a target of 40, pressing Item A adds 1. We now know A's value, 1. Pressing the B Item adds 10. The Current Total is now at 11. A press of Item C and 3 more are added to the Current Total. We are already at 14 so to solve the puzzle let's add C twice more and B twice more as well. This will total 40 our target value and we have won the game. 

A new game is started automatically.
